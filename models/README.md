> **Note:** The Llama-3.2-1B model download from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/bartowski/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf) is only needed for local development when building `Dockerfile-LM`. 
> 
> For deployment, the pre-built image on Docker Hub already contains the model.
